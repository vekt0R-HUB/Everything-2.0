# Everything 2.0

The purpose of this repository is to create a software written in C# that grants the user a much faster way to traverse the files in their computer (ideally Windows users because Linux user have ext4 that's already really fast).

For now the way it is meant to work is the following:

- First of all, dependencies:
  - .NET 6.0 SDK [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

- Go to the Tester folder and call the method Searching.Search using two parameters: the first is the path where to look and the second is the query
